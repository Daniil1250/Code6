Blinker is a low contrast sans serif typeface with a _squircle_ as its basic shape, think squarish curves, or Eurostyle’s flamboyant cousin. It’s best used for medium to large text, rather than a long copy. To do its claim justice Blinker also comes with a headline weight with an extra large x-height, tight spacing, and glyphs drawn more narrowly. Blink!

The original 9 weights with a latin extended glyph set were designed by [supertype’s](https://supertype.de) Jürgen Huber in 2019.
